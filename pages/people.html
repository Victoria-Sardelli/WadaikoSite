                <p>Masanori Seto, now in Kōchi, Japan, provided the opportunity for WADAIKO's beginning. Masaさん is best friends with Kenji Furutate and hosted the taiko workshop in October 2015, which led to the discovery of taiko for our members. Then employed with Cornell University, Masaさん taught WADAIKO's first members for seven weeks, creating the foundation of our group. He is also the one who came up with the idea for our name!</p>

                <p>Fascinated by taiko since the age of 18, Kenji Furutate followed his passion to become a professional taiko player. Kenji writes songs and performs solo around the world while keeping a principal position in “On-Ami,” a taiko group, and “DTT,” a band of taiko players, drummers, and tap dancers. Kenji hopes to return to New York as a self-established musician and intends to devote himself to promoting the soul-stirring beat of taiko to the people around the world.</p><br>
